# XMLBuilderFHM
This program creates project.rs.xml files for FHM (Fish Habitat Model) projects. "XMLBuilder.py" is essentially a wrapper for xml.etree.ElementTree that helps with code readability while creating the XML. It could very easily be used for creating XMLs for other projects.

"main.py" is the implementation for XMLBuilder in creating FHM XMLs. Applying it to other projects would be a significant undertaking, as it is specifically designed to navigate the FHM folder structure.
